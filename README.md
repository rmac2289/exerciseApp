# Meal Generator App

## This app allows the user to plan out a week's worth of meals based on their desired caloric intake, special diet, and food restrictions. 
## The user enters input for these fields and the generator will display breakfast, lunch, dinner, and daily nutritional information for every day of the week. 

## The app also allows the user to input an ingredient that they need for a recipe, and find a suitable substitute that they can use instead of that ingredient.
